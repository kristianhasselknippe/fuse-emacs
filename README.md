# fuse-mode
Emacs plugin for Fuse

M-x fuse-mode to connect to the fuse daemon.


I am currently using csharp-mode for uno and nXML-mode for UX.
These modes work quite nice until we get to do proper UNO and UX syntax highlighting. And we might be able
to derive from these.

- Error log

### Roadmap

- Code completion
- Project management (new project, creating files ...)
- Starting previews
- Selection

### Dependencies:
